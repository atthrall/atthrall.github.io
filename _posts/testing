Welcome to the site!

I have worn many hats. Here is a brief rundown in roughly reverse chronological order of some of the different projects I’ve been involved in over the years.

**[GetYourWritingDone.com]**
In 2021 I published The 12 Week Year for Writers, a book aimed at helping people become more productive writers, based on the original 12 Week Year system that I adopted way back as a young professor. The site provides resources to support writers, including a video guide to the book, planning templates, and a monthly newsletter.

**E38 Academy**
In 2019 I cofounded E38 Academy, an online training site for defense and intelligence professionals, with an old grad school friend. We launched in the fall and were acquired by a larger organization in the spring of 2020. Suddenly without a side hustle, I started writing the book that would help me launch GetYourWritingDone.com.

**Cato Institute**
In 2016 I became a Senior Fellow in the Cato Institute’s Defense and Foreign Policy department, spending two years full-time at the think tank while on leave from my university position. My focus was encouraging restraint in American foreign policy and measuring and monitoring the risks involved with U.S. arms sales. You can find my [Cato writings here].

**George Mason University**
From 2010 to 2022 I taught at GMU, where I headed the Biodefense graduate program for several years, helped create the Master’s in International Security program, mentored many fantastic master’s and Ph.D. students, and enjoyed leading study abroad trips to Switzerland. You can find my academic writings at [Google Scholar].

**Wolverine State Brewing Co.**
In 2007, a friend and I founded what is now, in my humble opinion, Michigan’s best brewery. You can find it online at [wolverinebeer.com]. If you ever find yourself driving from Ann Arbor, Michigan to Wilmington, N.C., be sure to toss a couple cases in the trunk for me.

**University of Michigan-Dearborn**
After receiving my Ph.D. in political science from M.I.T., I spent five years working for Michigan Virtual University, a nonprofit training organization, before finally landing a tenure-track academic job. I taught in the Social Sciences department at the University of Michigan-Dearborn from 2003 to 2010 and learned to be a professor from some of the best colleagues you could want.
