Welcome! I use this site as a hub connecting to the various spokes of my professional life. The list below is in roughly reverse chronological order.

GetYourWritingDone.com - In 2021 I published The 12 Week Year for Writers, a guide to help people become more productive writers. The site provides a variety of resources to support productive writing including video guides, planning templates, and an email newsletter.

Cato Insitute - From 2016 to 2023 I was a Senior Fellow in the Cato Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy department. My twin focuses there were tracking the risks of arms sales and encouraging greater restraint in U.S. foreign policy.

Wolverine State Brewing Co. - In 2007, I cofounded a brewery with a friend. You can find Michigan's best brewery at wolverinebeer.com.

Academia - I received my Ph.D. in political science from M.I.T. From 2003 to 2010 I was a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and from 2010 to 2022 I taught at George Mason University. You can find my publications here.
